# Calculator Fixed Point

FPGA-based digital calculator with 8-bit fixed-point operation with output on 7-segment display. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with 8-bit fixed-point number representation (5-bit integer and 3-bit fractional). The results of arithmetic operations are represented in 16-bit fixed-point numbers (10-bit integer and 6-bit fractional) and will be displayed on the 7-segment display in decimal numbers with 3-digit integer and 3-digit fractional.
